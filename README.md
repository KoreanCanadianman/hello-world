This repository is for practicing the Github Flow

Hello! Nice to meet you. You found my README file under the readme-edits branch!

After completing a pull request, I have deleted the readme-edits branch.

I followed the tutorial in the following link: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world

Feel free to try out the tutorial yourself and have a great rest of your day!
